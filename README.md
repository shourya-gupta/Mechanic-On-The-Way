# MECHANIC ON THE WAY




## Problem Statement

Vehicle breakdown in the middle of the road becomes problematic if faced out of your known town. Also, nowadays it puts safety, especially for women, in danger, because of the increase in the cases of defrauding.
 Even if the customer has contact details of the mechanic, he/she might not be available at that time, or can be out of reach. 

Everyone must have experienced such situation once in their life, and this problem affects all the people who have, or travel in an automobile. 

Mechanics on the way is a web application which manages customer and mechanics. It includes registration of mechanics and will store all information in database which can be accessed by customer as well as admin.

 The software has ability to give unique ids to customers as well as mechanics to ensure proper working between the modules. 

## Solution

There is no reliable existing system that provides emergency mechanic services to the people in need. Our solution provides a suitable platform on which user can get immediate access to the emergency services with least amount of information being taken from the user. Consider your car being stuck in the middle of the road in another city. You might not have the contact details of any local mechanic or even if you are in your own city the mechanic might not have the required equipment for repairing the car. So our website deals with these problems in a very reliable and efficient way. Stagnate cars on the roads also pose a great threat to other drivers on the road and it might result into accidents. So our proposed website is the best solution against all such problems.
